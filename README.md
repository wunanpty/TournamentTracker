# TournamentTracker
A Tournament Tracker that sets up a schedule for teams to play each other in a single-elimination style matchup.
This is my self-motivated project, I learned it from this tutorial [Course Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfWxdh-_k_4). 
I learned to use C# to build a complete application from start to finish.  Using .net and Visual Studio, construct a tournament tracker application that is ready to launch.

## Useful for:
- Office ping pong tournaments
- Rec league playoffs
- 3v3 basketball leagues
- And many moreâ€¦

## The C# technology use in this project includes:
- Multi-form WinForms application
- In-depth Class Library
- SQL Database
- Text File Storage
- Dapper
- Linq
- Interface
- Emailing from C#
- Custom Events
- Advanced Debugging
